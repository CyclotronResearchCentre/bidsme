    """
    Tool for checking the series in the prepared dataset
    to be conformed with passed list. It may be used
    in preparation step in SessionEndEP, or in process/bidsify
    steps in SessioEP.

    Function returns true if all series in given path are in given list.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    path: str
        path to the folder to check, including the data type sub-folder,
        expected to exist
    expected_series: list
        list of expected series Ids (without series number) in expected order
    strict: bool
        if true, check will fail if several series in folder corresponds
        to same series in list
    complete: bool
        if true, fails if not all series in given list found in path
    order: bool
        if true, fails if series in given path are out of order given
        in list, order=True implies strict=True
    level: int
        defines in what logging cathegory error messages will be
        reported (set to logging.NOTSET to silence)

    Example:
    --------
    # In SessionEndEP, given
    #   preparefolder is the path to prepared dataset
    #   session is the BidsSession object passed to SessionEndEP
    #   series is a dictionary with session name as key, and list
    #       of series as values
