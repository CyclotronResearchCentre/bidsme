    """
    Concat nii images from recording into one 4D image, using
    nibabel.funcs.concat_images function

    If number of files in recording is too small (0, 1, <=skip)
    a warning will be shown and no concatination will be performed

    Original 3D images are removed, and filelist in recording
    is adapted.

    This function is intended to be run in SequennceEndEP, in order
    to avoid conflicts due to file removal

    Resulting file will be named as first file used to concatenation
    in order to conserve naming in case of use of header dumps

    Parameters:
    -----------
    outfolder: str
        path to output folder where data files has been copied
    recording: Modules.baseModule
        recording object to concat
    skip: int
        number of files to exclude from convertion, excluded
        files will be still removed
    keep: int
        maximum number of files to merge
    check_affines: bool
        If True, then check that all the affines for images 
        are nearly the same, raising a ValueError otherwise.
        Default is True
    axis: None or int
        If None, concatenates on a new dimension. This requires
        all images to be the same shape. If not None, concatenates
        on the specified dimension. This requires all images
        to be the same shape, except on the specified dimension.

    Returns:
    --------
    str:
        path to merged file

    Example:
    --------
    # In SequenceEndEP, given
    #   recording is BaseModule object
    #   outfolder is the path where files are copied
    if not dry_run:
        Convert3Dto4D(outfolder, recording)
